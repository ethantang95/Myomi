The task class consists of components where we need access to the data of the Myo.
It is decided that this should be an async or a multithreadded task so it will not take up the UI thread.
The myomi task will be running in a controlled infinite loop that is set externally by anything that initiates a task.
The task themselves will define what each task should do and how it should handle the data since the analyzer is passed into it

TODO:
Decide if the task need to pause instance collection
